# Salary-Predictor
The goal for a machine learning perspective would be to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset to identify patterns and relationships that could be valuable for building predictive models. This could involve understanding how different features such as job title, experience level, and company size correlate with salaries. Additionally, preprocessing steps like handling missing data and encoding categorical variables might be necessary. The ultimate objective could be to develop a machine learning model that predicts data science job salaries based on the provided features.
